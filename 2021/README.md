## Description

Your job is to help the elves by giving them the shortest viewing schedules that shows them every combination of movies so they can get SantaTV+ live as soon as possible! The elves have formed three movie-watching teams to lighten the load, so every combination must be seen by at least one of their groups. But theyâ€™re also pretty sure they want to kick off the movie marathon with the ðŸŽ… and ðŸ¤¶ movies back-to-back, so be sure that each group has all the combinations that start with those. And finally, the elves have agreed to two sugar breaks, so youâ€™re allowed to give each group up to two ðŸŒŸ wildcards, which will play all the movies at once while theyâ€™re snacking, which will help speed things along.
