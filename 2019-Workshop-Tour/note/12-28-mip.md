Note that the method discuss above optimized for a single day,

there is another code for optimizing for the 100 days :

Well-known fundamental algorithms (they have many variations):

- *Cycle canceling*: a general primal method.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem#endnote_K67)
- *Minimum mean cycle canceling*: a simple [strongly polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strongly_polynomial) algorithm.[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem#endnote_GT89)
- *Successive shortest path* and *capacity scaling*: dual methods, which can be viewed as the generalizations of the [Ford–Fulkerson algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford–Fulkerson_algorithm).[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem#endnote_EK72)
- *Cost scaling*: a primal-dual approach, which can be viewed as the generalization of the [push-relabel algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push-relabel_algorithm).[5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem#endnote_GT90)
- *[Network simplex algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_simplex_algorithm)*: a specialized version of the [linear programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming) [simplex method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_method).[6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum-cost_flow_problem#endnote_O97)
