## Description

Submissions are evaluated on the total amount of weight you fit into Santa's 1000 bags. The rules that govern gift packing are as follows:

* Overfilling a bag above the 50lb limit will cause the entire bag to count for nothing, without warning!
* No gift may be used more than once.
* Every bag must have 3 or more gifts.
