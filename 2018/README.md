## Description

This year, Rudolph believes he can motivate the overworked Reindeer team by wisely choosing the order in which they visit the houses on Santa's list. The houses in prime cities always leave carrots for the Reindeers alongside the usual cookies and milk. These carrots are just the sustenance the Reindeers need to keep pace. In fact, Rudolph has found that if the Reindeer team doesn't originate from a prime city exactly every 10th step, it takes the 10% longer than it normally would to make their next destination!
