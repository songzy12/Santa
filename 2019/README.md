## Description

Santa has exciting news! For 100 days before Christmas, he opened up tours to his workshop. Because demand was so strong, and because Santa wanted to make things as fair as possible, he let each of the 5,000 families that will visit the workshop choose a list of dates they'd like to attend the workshop.

Now that all the families have sent Santa their preferences, he's realized it's impossible for everyone to get their top picks, so he's decided to provide extra perks for families that don't get their preferences. In addition, Santa's accounting department has told him that, depending on how families are scheduled, there may be some unexpected and hefty costs incurred.

Santa needs the help of the Kaggle community to optimize which day each family is assigned to attend the workshop in order to minimize any extra expenses that would cut into next years toy budget! Can you help Santa out?
