## Description

Due to social distancing, only two elves can be in the break room at once. You and another team leader will take turns trying to get candy canes out of the 100 possible vending machines in the room, but each machine is unpredictable in how likely it is to work. You do know, however, that the more often you try to use a machine, the less likely it will give you a candy cane. Plus, you only have time to try 2000 times on the vending machines until you need to get back to the workshop!

If you can collect more candy canes than the other team leaders, youâ€™ll surely be able to help your team win Santa's contest! Try your hand at this multi-armed candy cane challenge!
