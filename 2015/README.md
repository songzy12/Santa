## Description

Your goal is to minimize total weighted reindeer weariness:

* Weighted Reindeer Weariness = (distance traveled) * (weights carried for that segment)
* All sleighs start from north pole (Lat=90, Long=0), then head to each gift in the order that a user gives, and then head back to north pole
* Sleighs have a base weight = 10
* Each sleigh has a weight limit = 1000 (excluding the sleigh base weight)
