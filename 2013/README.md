## Description

The sleigh and presents are discretized and described in units of the fundamental length unit \\(\ell\\). The sleigh is 1000 x 1000 with infinite vertical extent as needed by your highest placed present. The cells of the sleigh go from 1 to 1000 for the length and width, and 1 to infinity in height.

Presents come in random sizes and are represented by their extent in the x, y, and z dimensions. Each present has a PresentId, a number which determines the order in which it is to be delivered. Ideally, Present 1 is to be delivered first, Present 2 second, etc.
