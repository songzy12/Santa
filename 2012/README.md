## Description

You're looking for shortest-distance paths through a set of chimneys, but instead of providing one path, Santa asks you to provide two disjoint paths. If one of your paths contains an edge from A to B, your other path must not contain an edge from A to B or from B to A (either order still counts as using that edge). Your score is the larger of the two distances.  Santa asks competition winners to publish and open source the algorithms they use (for his future use, of course).
